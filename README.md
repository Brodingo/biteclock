# BiteClock 🧛‍♂️🐺⏲️

Add-on for Elder Scrolls Online

## Description

Provides a countdown timer for players that have a Vampire or Werewolf bite skill and want to know when it will be available for use. There is also guidance for finding shrines, which zones they are in and how to locate them. 

#### Motivation

This is my first Elder Scrolls Online add-on, I wanted to learn how they are created so I started with something I've wanted for myself. In game I like providing werewolf and vampire bites as a means to build community and save others money (since Zenimax offers bites at a premium that I think is too high). I've also really enjoyed learning Lua🌜. I look forward to using it in other places.
