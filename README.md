# BiteClock üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüê∫‚è≤Ô∏è

Add-on for Elder Scrolls Online

## Description

Provides a countdown timer for players that have either Vampire or Werewolf skill trees and want to know when their bite will be available for use. For players seeking a bite there is guidance for zone and shrine locations.

#### Motivation

This is my first Elder Scrolls Online add-on, I wanted to learn how they are created so I started with something I've wanted for myself. In game I like providing werewolf and vampire bites as a means to build community and save others money (since Zenimax offers bites at a premium that I think is too high). I've also really enjoyed learning Luaüåú. I look forward to using it in other places.
